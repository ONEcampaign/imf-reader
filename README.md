# imf-reader

A package to access IMF data. 

This package supports access to IMF data with no/limited accessibility through the API,
including the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database and Special Drawing Rights (SDR) data

__NOTE__:

This package is designed to scrape data from the IMF website. 
The IMF does not provide an official API for accessing WEO data yet. As a result, 
the tools in this package are subject to breakage if the IMF changes the structure of their website,
or releases corrupted data files or unexpected data formats. Please report any issues you encounter.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install imf-reader
```

## Usage

### 1. World Economic Outlook (WEO) data

WEO data is accessed through SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) files published by the IMF.
For more information on SDMX, please visit the [SDMX.org](https://sdmx.org/).

Tools to access WEO data can be found in the `weo` module.
Import the `weo` module and call the `fetch_data` function to retrieve the latest WEO data.

```python
from imf_reader import weo

df = weo.fetch_data()
print(df)

```

By default, the function will return the WEO data for the latest year available.
You can specify a version by passing the month and year of the version you want to retrieve.
NOTE: The WEO reports are released in April and October of each year. The month of the version must 
be either "April" or "October".

```python
df = weo.fetch_data(version=("April", 2020))
```

If the version of the data fetched is needed, it can be 
retrieved from the function attribute `last_version_fetched`.

```python
df = weo.fetch_data()
print(weo.fetch_data.last_version_fetched)
# >>> ('April', 2024) or whichever version was just fetched
```


Caching is used to avoid multiple requests to the IMF website for the same data and to enhance performance. 
Caching using the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm approach and stores data in RAM. The cache is cleared when the program is terminated.
To clear the cache manually, use the `clear_cache` function.

```python
weo.clear_cache()
```


For more advanced usage and tools for WEO data please use the [weo-reader package](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/weo-reader).


### 2. Special Drawing Rights (SDR) data

The SDR is an international reserve asset created by the IMF in 1969.
It is not a currency, but the holder of SDRs can exchange them for usable currencies in times of need.

Read more about SDRs at: https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2023/special-drawing-rights-sdr


Import the module

```python
from imf_reader import sdr
```

Read allocations and holdings data.

```python
sdr.fetch_allocations_holdings()
```
SDRs holdings and allocations are published at a monthly frequency. The function fetches the data for the latest month available.

To retrieve SDR holdings and allocations for a specific month and year, eg April 2021, pass the year and month as a tuple

```python
sdr.fetch_allocations_holdings((2021, 4))
```

Read interest rates. This function gets the historical interest rates for SDRs up to the most recent value available.

```python
sdr.fetch_interest_rates()
```

Read exchange rates. This function gets the historical exchange rates for SDRs up to the most recent value available.

```python
sdr.fetch_exchange_rates()
```
By default, the exchange rate is in USDs per 1 SDR. To get the exchange rate in SDRs per 1 USD, pass the unit basis as "USD"

```python
sdr.fetch_exchange_rates("USD")
```

To clear cached data use the `clear_cache` function.

```python
sdr.clear_cache()
```


## Contributing

This package relies on webscraping techniques to access data from the source. It is likely
that the functionality of this package will break if the IMF changes the structure of their website
or their data files. If you encounter any issues, please report them.
